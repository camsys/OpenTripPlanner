/**
 * This the goal direction heuristic used for transit searches.
 *
 * Euclidean heuristics are terrible for transit routing because the maximum transit speed is quite high, especially
 * relative to the walk speed. Transit can require going away from the destination in Euclidean space to approach it
 * according to the travel time metric. This heuristic is designed to be good for transit.
 *
 * After many experiments storing travel time metrics in tables or embedding them in low-dimensional Euclidean space I
 * eventually came to the conclusion that the most efficient structure for representing the metric was already right
 * in front of us: a graph.
 *
 * This heuristic searches backward from the target vertex over the street and transit network, removing any
 * time-dependent component of the network (e.g. by evaluating all boarding wait times as zero). This produces an
 * admissible heuristic (i.e. it always underestimates path weight) making it valid independent of the clock time.
 * This is important because you don't know precisely what time you will arrive at the destination until you get there.
 *
 * Because we often make use of the first path we find in the main search, this heuristic must be both admissible and
 * consistent (monotonic). If the heuristic is non-monotonic, nodes can be re-discovered and paths are not necessarily
 * discovered in order of increasing weight. When finding paths one by one and banning trips or routes,
 * suboptimal paths may be found and reported before or instead of optimal ones.
 *
 * This heuristic was previously not consistent for the reasons discussed in ticket #2153. It was possible for the
 * "zero zone" around the origin to overlap the egress zone around the destination, leading to decreases in the
 * heuristic across an edge that were greater in magnitude than the weight of that edge. This has been solved by
 * creating two separate distance maps, one pre-transit and one post-transit.
 *
 * Note that the backward search does not happen in a separate thread. It is interleaved with the main search in a
 * ratio of N:1 iterations.
